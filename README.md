# voron-mods

A repo of mode for my voron that others might benefit from.

README files are in individual folders.

## Contents

- **Rail Wedge** For emergencies only - use this if you have to build a VORON with V Profile extrusions instead of the BOM-recommended square profile nut slot extrusions.
